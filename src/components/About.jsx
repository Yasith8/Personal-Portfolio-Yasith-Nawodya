                After completing my A/Ls, I made the decision to delve into programming. 
                I enrolled in various online courses to grasp the basic fundamentals of software engineering. 
                Subsequently, I pursued a <span className='font-semibold'>degree in Information Technology at the University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC)</span>. 
                Throughout my academic journey, I've acquired a comprehensive understanding of essential concepts vital to the software industry, 
                such as agile development, data structures and algorithms, and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Currently, 
                I am a <span className='font-semibold'>final year undergraduate at UCSC</span>.

                In my spare time, I indulge in learning new programming languages and technologies. <span className='font-semibold'>My primary focus</span> lies in mastering 
                the <span className='font-semibold'>MERN Stack</span>â€”a versatile combination of React.js, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js.
                Beyond coding, I find joy in a myriad of activities. Whether it's immersing myself in the latest blockbuster film, 
                Playing Cricket, delving into the depths of world history, or getting lost in the pages of a captivating book,
                 I thrive on exploration and discovery.
